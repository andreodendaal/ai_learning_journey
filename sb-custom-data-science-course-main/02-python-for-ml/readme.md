# Working With Python and Key ML Libraries

Today is a doozy!

We're going to review a few critical Python concepts (looping, lists, dictionaries, functions and classes) then dive right into machine learning.

Python is popular for machine learning in no small part due to the wealth of available open source libraries and APIs focused on ML tasks. The ecosystem surrounding the language is at least as important as the language itself in terms of how the language ends up being used in the software industry.

In this class we'll introduce some of the most commonly used ML libraries in Python and use them to train and evaluate some simple ML models. 

## Class Topics

* Fundamental Python Review
    * Lists
    * Dictionaries
    * Loops
    * Functions
    * Classes

* Using Jupyter Notebooks vs a text editor.
* EDA and Data Cleaning with Pandas.
* Scikit-learn's API.
* Test/train/validation data splits.
* The K-nearest Neighbor algorithm.

* Exercises: 
    * Review the Python fundamentals.
    * Use Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform descriptive statistics and create charts.
    * Modify the parameters of a K-NN model and evaluate the changing performance.
    * Use Scikit Learn to build a predictive model using a different algorithm.
